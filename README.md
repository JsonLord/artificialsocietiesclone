The App Agentic User Experience (AUX) is a pioneering project exploring the future of human-computer interaction through agent-based systems. This application provides a framework for understanding, simulating, and interacting with intelligent agents in a user-friendly environment.

Key Features:
- **Real-time Agent Simulation**: Observe and interact with AI agents in dynamic environments.
- **Configurable Scenarios**: Customize simulation parameters to explore different agent behaviors and outcomes.
- **Intuitive Visualization**: Understand complex agent interactions through clear and interactive graphical representations.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extend and adapt the framework for various research and development purposes.

This project aims to bridge the gap between complex AI research and practical, accessible applications, offering a glimpse into a future where AI agents seamlessly augment our daily digital lives.
